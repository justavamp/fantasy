                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>My name is Gopika Shaji. I am pursuing a professional qualification in <strong>Forensics and Cyber Security</strong>. Now, I am looking for part-time internships and have been completing courses related to <strong>Information Technology and Cybersecurity.</strong> I am currently working as a part-time HTML intern in the NGO, Society for Health and Medical Technology. I cannot say with 100% confidence where I see myself in five years or what my big career goal is, but one thing I know for sure is that I will definitely prove myself to be <strong>a self-sufficient, strong and an independent woman</strong> who can handle any problem thrown at her with ease and grace. The world is changing rapidly, and I donâ€™t have enough professional experience to be certain about the exact job I will be pursuing. However, I know that I can provide a fresh take and an extraordinary approach to every project. I am always open to challenges and constructive feedback. I am open-minded and learn new things quickly. I want to become a team player and dedicate all my skills and talents to develop high-quality and unique products.</p>
